This page is a compilation of all the tools that I use day-to-day in no particular order.


### [Standard Notes](https://standardnotes.com/)

It's my favorite tool for taking notes. What I like the most about the app is that the team behind it believes in [people's privacy](https://standardnotes.com/privacy) and the [longevity](https://standardnotes.com/longevity) of the notes that people create. In a world where FOMOed investors are backing short-lived products, we need to support the people that believe in long-lived technological products that are self-funded.

### [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

It's my favorite code editor when I'm not doing Swift development. It's fast, extensible, customizable, and works incredibly well with Typescript.

### [Apple Podcasts](https://www.apple.com/apple-podcasts/)

Prior to Apple Podcasts, I was using [Pocket Casts](https://www.pocketcasts.com/) and I liked the user experience more. However, I transitioned from some services to Apple's to have everything under the same umbrella subscription, and I included podcasts in the migration pack.

### [NetNewsWire](https://netnewswire.com/)

NetNewsWire is my RSS reader. It's open-source and perfectly syncs the list of feeds across iOS and macOS through [iCloud](https://www.icloud.com/). I've been following its creator, [Brent Simmons](https://twitter.com/brentsimmons), for a while and I find his work in the open and aligned with Apple's guidelines inspiring.

### [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/)

SvelteKit became my go-to framework for building websites after having used [GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) for years.
SvelteKit doesn't force you into any particular way of building websites. You can choose on a per-page basis the type of rendering that you want: SSR, CSR, or Pre-render. Moreover, you get the option to disable Javascript completely from the rendered pages, and it has [adapters](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/blob/master/documentation/docs/10-adapters.md) that adapt the websites to different infrastructure providers. And last but not least, the language for declaring the components alongside their styles and dynamic behaviors is closer to the standards and more aligned with best programming principles.


### [GitHub](https://github.com)

GitHub is my favorite remote Git provider. I built my curriculum into it. I got very used to the product, its interface, and I provides everything I need when building software: pull requests, issues, discussions, continuous integration.

### [Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/)

<img src="https://cdn3.iconfinder.com/data/icons/popular-services-brands-vol-2/512/ruby-on-rails-512.png" width="100" alt="Rails icon"/>

Rails is my go-to full-stack web framework. It's written in Ruby, a programming language that I love. It provides utilities for most of common operations web services have to perform, and can be easily deployed to platforms like Heroku
